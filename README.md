# BTC (Un)Locking Scripts Cheatsheet

Sharing my self-study notes about main flavours (as of Q3 2019) of Bitcoin Locking and Unlocking Scripts; I have edited them in this recap cheatsheet, hoping to give back something to the community from which I got a lot in last couple of years (On [Medium](https://medium.com/@baro77/btc-locking-and-unlocking-scripts-cheatsheet-ff6d515447de) you can find some more words about my motivations)
